EvoDashboard is a modern and customizable Welcome Dashboard for MODx Evolution with widget support, based on (and replace)  OnManagerWelcomeCustom  plugin.

The most important difference between **OnManagerWelcomeCustom** and **EvoDashboard** is that EvoDashboard works with all MODX Evolution manager themes !
