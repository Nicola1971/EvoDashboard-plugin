EvoDashboard-plugin 3.0
===================
Info and docs: http://www.tattoocms.it/extras/plugins/evodashboard-plugin-modx-evolution-dashboard.html

EvoDashboard is a modern, customizable, responsive, Boostrap Welcome Dashboard for MODx Evolution with widget support, based on (and replace)  OnManagerWelcomeCustom  plugin.

The most important difference between **OnManagerWelcomeCustom** and **EvoDashboard** is that EvoDashboard works with all MODX Evolution manager themes !
